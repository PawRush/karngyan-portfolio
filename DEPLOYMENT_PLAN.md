# Deployment Plan: Karngyan Pipeline

Coding Agents should follow this Deployment Plan, and validate previous progress if picking up the Deployment in a new coding session.

**IMPORTANT**: Update this plan after EACH step completes. Mark the step `[x]` and update `last_updated` timestamp.

## Phase 1: Gather Context and Configure
- [x] Step 0: Inform User of Execution Flow
- [x] Step 1: Create Deployment Plan
- [ ] Step 2: Detect Existing Infrastructure
  - [ ] 2.1: Detect stacks and frontend
  - [ ] 2.2: Detect app name and git repository
  - [ ] 2.3: Determine quality checks
  - [ ] 2.4: User confirmation
  - [ ] 2.5: Use existing CodeConnection

## Phase 2: Build and Deploy Pipeline
- [ ] Step 3: Create CDK Pipeline Stack
- [ ] Step 4: CDK Bootstrap
- [ ] Step 5: Deploy Pipeline
  - [ ] 5.1: Push to remote
  - [ ] 5.2: Verify CodeConnection
  - [ ] 5.3: Deploy pipeline stack
  - [ ] 5.4: Trigger pipeline
- [ ] Step 6: Monitor Pipeline

## Phase 3: Documentation
- [ ] Step 7: Finalize Deployment Plan
- [ ] Step 8: Update README.md
